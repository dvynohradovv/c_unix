# c_unix

Welcome! This repository showcases my journey mastering C programming and the Unix subsystem. Developed as part of my university assignments, it demonstrates my understanding of low-level programming, system calls, and efficient problem-solving in a Unix environment.

## About This Project

- Written primarily in **C**, with supplemental Makefiles and Assembly where performance or system integration matters.
- Focuses on practical, real-world problems faced in Unix systems.
- Each project/file here is the result of hands-on work, debugging, and optimization.

## Why This Repo Stands Out

- Deep System Knowledge: Not just “hello, world!” – I dive into processes, memory management, file systems, and inter-process communication.
- Clean, Readable Code: My C code is well-structured, with meaningful comments and modular organization.
- Unix Subsystem Proficiency: Confident with shell scripting, Makefiles, and integrating C with Assembly for performance-critical tasks.

## Technologies Used

- C
- Unix/Linux
- Makefile
- Assembly
- (A little C++ where appropriate)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo:  
   git clone https://github.com/dvynohradovv/c_unix.git

2. Build with Make:  
   make

3. Run any executable or browse the source for examples of system-level programming.
